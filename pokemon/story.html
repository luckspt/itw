              now. Regardless of which camp you are in, sit back, grab your beverage of choice and relax—we are going to take a trip back in time to the very beginning of Pokémon.Pokémon is short for “Pocket Monsters&quot;, the original Japanese name. The
              franchise has its roots in a gaming magazine in the early 1980s in Japan—Game Freak, started by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori. Tajiri was the writer, while Sugimori was the illustrator.<br />They soon realized that the arcade scene at the
              time wasn’t too hot anymore and decided to develop games themselves. This included games that were published by Nintendo on the NES and Game Boy like Yoshi and even games for SEGA like Magical Tarurūto-kun on the Mega Drive, SEGA’s console.
              In its time as a developer, Game Freak had its titles published by the likes of even Sony back then.<br />When Tajiri and Co. put forth the idea of Pokémon to Nintendo, though, the publishers didn’t really get it. However, Tajiri was given
              the benefit of doubt thanks to the success of Game Freak’s previous titles, and he worked under the mentorship of Shigeru Miyamoto to create Pocket Monsters: Red and Green, a game that combined the collecting and trading of monsters. And thus
              began a franchise that went on to become the second largest gaming franchise ever. (In case you are wondering, Mario is the largest, and it also happens to be owned by Nintendo.).<br />Credit to, livemint.com.</p>
